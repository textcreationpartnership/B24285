            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap> of the very thing, which has here befallen us. But it seems, by the Inadvertency of a <hi>Youth,</hi> who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by our Usual <hi>Clark</hi> (then forc'd to leave the Town by a long and extream Sickness, as we can prove) to write into <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester-shire</hi> for an Exact Account of the State of our <hi>Friends</hi> in Relation to this Prosecution, it was omitted, and the Account for the <hi>County</hi> inserted, as it was taken out of the <hi>Pipe;</hi> which consisted but of <hi>Three</hi> Persons, whereof <hi>Two</hi> of them, it seems, are <hi>Papists,</hi> and the <hi>Third</hi> an Observer of the <hi>Jewish-Sabboth.</hi> And though these Men of Malice might as well have concluded us <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Papists</hi> from this Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet because the <hi>Papist</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a more Scandalous Creature then the <hi>Jew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">So the Accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us calls the Person that holds the <hi>seventh day Sabboth.</hi>
               </note> that reflection would not have serv'd their End; whose Contrivance it is to turn the Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Papists</hi> upon the <hi>Quakers:</hi> And why? but to save them; at least to ruin us, the Design of those that are <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>Popishly Affected;</hi> who by these Devices seek to amuse the People, and to make honest Men jealous one of another. But the <hi>Reasons</hi> to be offered, why the <hi>Story</hi> is <hi>Incredible,</hi> are these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be thought, if we had design'd to <hi>Conceal</hi> the <hi>Papists,</hi> but that we would have spared our Care in the rest of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:207779:3"/>the <hi>Counties,</hi> or have taken more care to have brought them in in other places; which it is plain, we have not done.</p>
            <p>But 2dly, It is not probable, that we should by <hi>Design</hi> bring in known <hi>Papists,</hi> and none of our own <hi>Friends</hi> amongst them; for not one of them was presented with those <hi>Three</hi> persons in the List of <hi>Glocester-shire.</hi> Whereas had we intended such a thing, it had looked more like a <hi>Design, To have inserted them amongst the Names of our Friends,</hi> (as we might have done in other Counties) that so we might the better have screen'd them from common Observation, especially knowing the Mischief of such Attempts detected.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Men Generally propose some <hi>Advantage</hi> to themselves in what they do; but there could redound no Benefit to us in the Earth by this Project, and even to the <hi>Papists</hi> a very small one: but the Danger of being <hi>Caught,</hi> would have been <hi>Fatal.</hi> So that we must have been greatly false to our own <hi>Interest,</hi> to run an <hi>Hazard</hi> of this Consequence to us for so <hi>Trivial</hi> a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, This was near <hi>Two Years</hi> ago, that the <hi>Omission</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the first Copy of the List; at what time it is easie to believe, that the Circumstances of the <hi>Papists</hi> were not so <hi>low</hi> or <hi>desperate,</hi> as that they should need the <hi>Quakers</hi> skill to put a Trick upon the <hi>Government</hi> for their Security: It is not hard to remember, that they then stood upon better Terms. But any thing it seems will serve (be it never so <hi>False</hi> or <hi>Foolish</hi>) that will but Bedirt us.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, To be Modest, and yet to Defend our selves against such <hi>Injurious Apprehensions,</hi> as are entertained of us; We must say, that we <hi>lay</hi> under the <hi>Furious Execution</hi> of those Laws against <hi>Popish-Recusants</hi> (<hi>Sixty</hi> Pounds having been taken for <hi>Thirteen</hi> Pound, and not a <hi>Penny</hi> returned, as we made appear before the late <hi>Parliament</hi>) to the Impoverishing of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:207779:4"/>many <hi>Industrious</hi> and <hi>Peaceable</hi> People; when scarce one <hi>Papist</hi> was toucht in whole <hi>Counties:</hi> Can any think, that the <hi>Papists</hi> needed us to hide them at that time of Day? Or doth this Usage of us prove us <hi>Papists,</hi> when <hi>Papists</hi> were not toucht?</p>
            <p n="6">6thly, It cannot be <hi>Reasonably</hi> conceiv'd, that we being to make good these <hi>Allegations</hi> in the last <hi>Parliament</hi> (who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a <hi>Committee</hi> for that purpose) should knowingly run our selves into such a <hi>Snare,</hi> as this was: And such was our <hi>Carriage</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> before them, both with respect to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Things, that they declared their <hi>Satisfaction</hi> about us and our <hi>Suffering Friends,</hi> as those that <hi>Well deserv'd</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>Protestant-Dissenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7thly, It is good old Doctrine, <hi>That the Tree is known by its Fruit;</hi> and it is plain, that among other things, in the <hi>Election</hi> of this present <hi>Parliament,</hi> we have not shown our selves to be <hi>Popishly</hi> Affected in the Disposal of our <hi>Voices;</hi> perhaps we stand upon even Terms at least, with any of our Enemies, as to our good <hi>Affection</hi> to the <hi>Publick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> We offer the Affixed <hi>Declaration,</hi> as our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against <hi>Popery,</hi> and of our good Affection to the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and Resolution to lead a Sober and Peaceable Life under the present <hi>Government.</hi>
